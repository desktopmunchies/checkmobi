                <p class="marketing-text">
                    A user that wants to get verified will receive a missed call from a random number. The last
                    4 digits from the incoming number represent the one-time password (or pin number) that the
                    user needs to validate his mobile number.

                    That when used properly, can reduce the cost of mobile number verification. It can achieve
                    this because the verification uses a missed call (with no answer) so there is no charge from
                    the telecom providers.

                <p class="marketing-text">
                    That can increase your chances of success when verifying a mobile number. Missed call operates via
                    calling medium unlike SMS so in the rare case that an SMS is delayed or does not reach a certain
                    destination, a missed call verification might get that number verified. Ideally, the perfect flow
                    should have all verification methods integrated: Missed Call, SMS &amp; IVR Call.

                <p class="marketing-text">
                    Missed call cannot remove the cost of verification entirely. If a missed call gets answered then
                    it becomes a normal call and you will be charged the cost of 1 minute of calling towards the
                    destination of the user. Some scenarios when a missed call is answered (could be more):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When is directed instantly to voicemail.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the number is inserted wrongfully and someone else responds the call.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The user receiving the call answers instantly.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p class="marketing-text">
                    However, a correct missed call implementation should not have more than 2-3% of missed calls
                    getting answered.

                    It is not to be used stand-alone as a single verification method.
                    Missed call works best when it is set as the primary verification method to reduce cost, but has an
                    automatic fallback to SMS in case the number did not get verified.

                </h2>
                <p class="marketing-text">
                    Missed call works great on Android because of the operating system that with the right
                    permissions can allow your app to automatically intercept the call and use the last digits
                    as pin number transforming the experience into 1 click verification.
                </p>
                <p class="marketing-text">
                    On iOS the user needs to enter himself the last 4 digits so it requires extra explanations
                    and user input.
                </p>
                <p class="marketing-text">
                    On web, it could be very misleading as the user now has to receive the call on a mobile
                    device
                    and make sure he enters the last 4 digits from a missed call on a desktop device.
