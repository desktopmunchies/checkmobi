                You can, but we recommend implementing SMS as fallback for number verification. The reason is that
                on some destinations Caller ID is not sent correctly. You have similar problems with SMS when it does
                not reach or has 1h delays. The best way to do this is :
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Set Missed call (Reverse caller ID) as primary method of verification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use SMS or/and IVR call as fallback if Missed Call fails.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Missed Call uses the incoming number to deliver the pin that normally gets sent via SMS. See below

                Although a successful Missed Call verification does not cost anything, there are reasons when a Missed
                Call
                can cost you:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If your user enters a wrong number and we call someone else, and that person answers the call.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In case your user answers the missed call fast enough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the call is rejected from the phone side and user has voice mail activated on call reject.
                        (That is why
                        it is very important when you implement Missed Call to always call our API to hangup the call
                        from the server.
                        Never from the client directly)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                If a missed call is answered we will charge you the rate for 1 minute of calling on that destination.
                See rates
                <a class="link" target="_blank" [routerLink]="['/pricing']" fragment="Rates">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                Because we get charged, we need to charge you when these rare situations happen. That is why you need to
                have
                credit available in order to use Missed Call.
                <br><br>
                NOTE: We have a server setting to hangup fast from the server after the missed call is placed. This
                can be adjusted to decrease the ringing time on the userâ€™s phone.

                Make sure your user entered correctly his number. If this is the case, then it could be a problem
                of delay on the network side from us sending the call to reaching your user. This delay can have a
                few seconds.<br>There is a setting in "General Settings" section within your application called:
                "Missed Call ring time". This is the time it passes before we hangup the call, so your users
                don't have time to answer it. Try increasing it and see if calls reach your desired destination.

                If you correctly implemented missed call verification it means you have 2 things:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        SMS is set as fallback when Missed Call does not send correct Caller ID.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can turn on/off Missed Call on a certain destination.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                In this case, just turn off Missed Call for that destination and open a ticket on
