                You may receive alert emails from CheckMobi when thereâ€™s an error generated by an application
                that you are running.<br><br>
                These alerts provide a way for you to get notifications on any potential issues with your
                application. By default CheckMobi has three triggers in place when an account is initially
                created: emails will be sent to the account owner when the 1st, 10th and 100th application
                error occurs each day.<br><br>
                When you receive an email like this, check out the <a target="_blank" class="link"
                                                                      href="https://checkmobi.com/account.html#/logs">Logs</a>
                for detailed error codes and descriptions, or you may want to reach out to
                whoever developed your CheckMobi application if you do not maintain it yourself.<br><br>
                If you do not need these default triggers, you can delete them right from the "Alerts" tab
                that can be found on your application in the <a target="_blank" class="link"
                                                                href="https://checkmobi.com/account.html#/settings/account-info/">Settings</a>
                tab.
